Approach: Followed the "given when then" structure to write a spec file testing what I wanted the generator to do, then started trying to figure out how the input (n) related to the formula given on the Wiki. With some help I reviewed how recursive functions are coded and had the fibonacci function call itself. I then returned to the spec to refactor and write additional test cases for input I did not want my fibonacci generator to accept.
